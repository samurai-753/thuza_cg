- PickName() is now const.
Apr 22, 2008 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added pickName attribute and related methods because it is not possible to 
  cast pointers to unsinged int on 64bit platforms as previosly done at 
  GraphicObj::DrawForPicking().
- Removed Copy() because it must allocate memory inside the library that must
  be deallocated by the user (against our policy). It would be better to make
  "GraphicObj"s childless.
Feb 08, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added "void ToggleRecVisibility()".
- Added "void SetBBoxColor(VART::Color value)".
Feb 06, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added virtual VART::SceneNode * Copy() method declaration. All derivated 
  classes must implement this method.
Aug 29, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added DrawForPicking().
Jul 03, 2006 - Dalton Reis
- Unnecessary const in SetBBoxVisibility.
Jul 03, 2006 - Dalton Reis
- Added SetBBoxVisibility().
May 30, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- General renaming to account for project rename (VPAT->V-ART).
- ComputeRecursiveBoundingBox now enters transforms.
- Removed RecursiveBoundingBox. GetRecursiveBoundingBox should be used instead.
- Added ToggleRecBBoxVisibility.
- Removed bBoxShow because VPBoundingBox already has a visibility flag.
May 08, 2006 - Dalton Reis
- Added a RecursiveBoundingBox method
Feb 17, 2006 - Andreia Schneider
- Removed const of the VPSceneNode in method ComputeRecursiveBoundingBox.
- Added bBoxShow (attribute that indicates if the bounding box is visible, or not).
Jan 25, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider

Apr 27, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added ToggleVisibility() and IsVisible().
Dec 03, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added bBox, recBBox and related methods.
Oct 13, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Code typing has been cleaned. DoxyGen documentation started.
- Removed "using namespace std" from header file.
- Removed "vp" prefix from every method name.
- Removed IVPATH declaration.
- VPGraphicObj is now derived from VPSceneNode. AS A RESULT, MOST METHODS AND
  ATRIBUTES WERE REMOVED.
May 04, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Commented out IVPATH declaration.
Jul 25, 2000 - Anderson Maciel
- Classes declaration.
