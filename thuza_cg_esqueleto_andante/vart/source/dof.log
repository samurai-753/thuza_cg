Mar 16, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added code to draw DOFs if symbol VISUAL_JOINTS is defined.
- Removed Transform(const VPTransform&).

- VPDof(const VPPoint4D&, const VPPoint4D&, float, float) now computes LIM.
- GetDescription is now inline and returns by reference.
- DOFs are now derived from memory objects. The programmer no longer needs to keep track
  of all DOFs in a body.
- Added some documentation.
Oct 08, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Code typing has been cleaned (tabs replaced by spaces, excessive spaces

- Removed "#include <stdio.h>". Removed "PrintLim" method.
- Removed "vp" prefix from every method name.
- Moved "using namespace std" from header file to implementation file.
- Changed type of "lim" attribute from "VPMatrix" to "VPTransform".
- Changed type of "axis" and "position" attributes to VPPoint4D.
- Changed "SetDescription" to avoid passing a string by value and removed the
  "char*" version because it is not needed.
- Changed "GetEvoluta".
- Commented out "bim" attribute which was never used.
- Commented out "GetBim()".
- Added "Move" (inline) and "Transform(const VPTransform&)" methods.
