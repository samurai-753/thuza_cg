Nov 08, 2016 - Bruno Schneider
- SetVertices(const std::vector<VART::Point4D>&) now fills vertVec (not only vertCoordVec).
Apr 13, 2015 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- ReadVertex now returns bool.
- Started exception handling in this class.
May 06, 2014 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added void AddMesh(const Mesh&).
- void SetVertices(const std::vector<Point4D>&) no longer creates an unoptimized mesh.
  I belived unoptimized meshes are not needed.
Sep 26, 2013 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Fixed initial mesh with no type in ReadFromOBJ.
Sep 24, 2013 - Carlos Drury, Rodrigo T. M. Caldas, Thiago P. Nobre & Bruno Schneider
- Improved handling of vertex/texture/normal in ReadFromOBJ.
- MeshObject::MakeBox is deprecated in favor of VART::Box.
- Started an implementation for printing a MeshObject as text (operator<<).
Sep 23, 2013 - André Veiga S. Tonelli, Raphael Luís T. Costa, Rhyad Kryn S. Janse & Bruno Schneider
- ReadFromOBJ now handles faces with more than 3 vertices.
Oct 01, 2012 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added some documentation.
- Reads and ignores "Ni" values in MTL files now (ReadMaterialTable).
- Now handles omitted texture indexes on faces (ReadFromOBJ).
- Now handles normal indexes that were reused between objects in a obj file (ReadFromOBJ).
Oct 09, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added void SmallerVertex(Point4D* resultPtr).
- Fixed some documentation.
- Marked GetVertexMedia() as deprecated.
Mar 12, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Converted 'tabs' to 'spaces' on the files.
- Reverted the textCoordVec atribute from double to float.
- Corrected a error in ReadFromOBJ() method documentation.
- Changed calls from VART::XmlBase::GetPathFromString() method to the new class
  VART::File::GetPathFromString().
Mar 05, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Changed "static void ReadFromOBJ(const std::string& filename, std::list<MeshObject*>* resultPtr)"
  to "static bool ReadFromOBJ(const std::string& filename, std::list<MeshObject*>* resultPtr)".
Feb 23, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added "void SetNormals(const std::vector<Point4D>& normalVec)"
- Modified the attribute textCoordVec from type std::vector<float> to std::vector<double>.
- Modified "MeshObject::MakeBox" method, to create the texture vertices with the box.
- Modified "MeshObject::DrawInstanceOGL()", to draw the texture with the mesh, if its the case.
- Modified "MeshObject::ReadFromOBJ", to read correctly the texture vertices.
- Modified "MeshObject::ReadMaterialTable" method, to read textures with the materials.
Feb 13, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Now, the bounding box and the recursive bounding box can be draw if 'show' attribute
  is false.
Feb 08, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added #include "vart/xmlbase.h"
- The method MeshObject::ReadFromOBJ(const string& filename, list<VART::MeshObject*>* resultPtr)
  now can load an .obj file from an directory different from current directory (that
  the programmer application runs).
Feb 06, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added virtual VART::SceneNode * Copy() method implementation.
- The copy constructor now calls the copy operator.
- The copy operator now calls the GraphicObj copy operator.
Jul 04, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Changed TABs into spaces.
- Fixed compiler (g++) errors and warnings.
Jun 23, 2006 - Cleber Souza Ughini
- Added public Method ComputeSubBBoxes, GetSubBBoxes.
- Added private methods subDivideBBox, computeNewSubBBox.
- Added private atribute subBBoxes.
Jun 07, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Changed ComputeBoundingBox( VART::Transform* trans, VART::BoundingBox* bb ) into
  ComputeBoundingBox(const Transform& trans, BoundingBox* bbPtr).
May 31, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Renamed Transform(...) to ApplyTransform because it was conflicting with Transform class.
- General renaming to account for project rename (VPAT->V-ART).
- DrawInstanceOGL now checks if it should draw the recursive bounding box.
- Removed references to bBoxShow.
Feb 16, 2006 - Andreia Schneider
- DrawInstanceOGL modified to allow the bounding box to be drawn.
Jan 27, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Fixed some bugs in ReadFromOBJ.
- Added sizeOfNormals class attribute.
- Added GetVerticesCoordinates(), GetVertex() and SetVertex().
Jun 22, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Fixed and enhanced documentation.
Jun 13, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Moved code to enable vertex arrays from constructor into vpviewerglutogl.
- Added IsEmpty.
- DrawInstanceOGL now respects the "show" attribute.
Jan 31, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added faceCounter to ReadFromOBJ.
Dec 16, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added Clear, MakeBox, GetYProjection, SetMaterial, DrawInstanceOGL and GetID.
- Attribute vertVec was a vector of pointer to points and is now a vector of
  points. Work with the ConvexHull class showed that it would be better if a
  MeshObject could manage its own storage. Accordingly, normVec had its type
  changed.
- Fixed DrawInstanceOGL(), so that it now works with unoptimized meshes.
- Added SetVertices, AddFace and ComputeBoundingBox.
- Added Transform, MergeWith, ReadFromOBJ and ReadMaterialTable.
- Added a copy constructor and operator=.
Sep 22, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- File created.
