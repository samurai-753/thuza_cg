- Added "void GetDofs(std::list<Dof*>* dofListPtr)".
- Changed "GetDof(DofID)" to "GetDof(DofID) const".
May 30, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& input,  Joint::DofID& dofId).
- XmlPrintOn now checks the new "recursivePrinting" attribute from SceneNode.
Feb 06, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Now, the copy constructor calls the copy operator.
- Added virtual VART::SceneNode * Copy() method implementation.
- Added virtual void CopyDofListFrom( VART::Joint& joint ) method implementation. 
  Here, the joint list of joint is copied to 'this' instance, setting the ownerJoint 
  attribute of the copied dofs to 'this' instance.
Nov 23, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- GetNumDofs is now const and inline.
- Added "virtual void XmlPrintOn(std::ostream&, unsigned int) const".
Nov 20, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added copy constructor and operator=.
- Added operator<< for Joint::DofID.
- Added DofID GetDofID(const Dof*) const.
- Added HasDof(DofID).
Oct 20, 2006 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added '#include <windows.h>' for compilation under MS-Windows.
May 30, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- General renaming to account for project rename (VPAT->V-ART).
- Added MoveDof.
Mar 24, 2006 - Andreia Schneider
- Added method to put the joint in a rest position.
Mar 16, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added code to draw DOFs when symbol VISUAL_JOINTS is defined.
- Removed TransformDofs(VPDof*, const VPTransform&).
Feb 17, 2006 - Andreia Schneider
- Included cassert library.
Oct 27, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added GetDof.
- Removed #include "vart/matrix.h".
- Removed unused MAXDOF constant.
May 18, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added destructor that deletes DOFs marked as autoDelete.
Jan 10, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added "#include <algorithm>" because MS VC++ users reported compilation errors.
Oct 08, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Code typing has been cleaned (tabs replaced by spaces, excessive spaces
  removed, etc.) because tabs and spaces were mixed together.
- Removed "#include <stdio.h>" from implementation file. Commented out 
  "PrintLim" method.
- Moved "using namespace std" from header file to implementation.
- Removed 'vp' preffix of every method name.
- Turned VPJoint a subclass of VPTransform. AS A RESULT, MOST ATTRIBUTES AND
  METHODS WERE REMOVED.
- Reimplemented "MakeLim()".
- Added "TransformDofs(VPDof*, const VPTransform&)" so that when one DOF changes
  it may changed its siblings. This is temporary behaviour - how changes should
  be carried to the siblings is still an open issue!
Aug 10, 2000 - Anderson Maciel
- Class and new methods declaration.
