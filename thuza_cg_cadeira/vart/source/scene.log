- UseNextCamera and UsePreviousCamera now return a pointer to the new current camera.
- Marked GetCameras as deprecated.
- Changed DrawOGL() to DrawOGL(Camera* cameraPtr = NULL) to make it easier for viewers to show a
  scene using different cameras.
- Marked GetObjectRec as deprecated.
Aug 08, 2008 - Kao Cardoso Félix
- Changed the order of the calls to DrawLightsOGL and (*currentCamera)->DrawOGL(), 
  to fix a bug that caused the light to being not affected by the camera transform
  at the first rendering of the scene.
 Aug 07, 2008 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Removed GetObjectTranformMatrix.
- Added SceneNode* GetObject(unsigned int) as an auxiliary method for
  void Pick(int, int, list<GraphicObj*>*). Need because of the new scheme for
  converting names into pointers that also works on AMD64.
May 30, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Marked GetAllSceneTypeObject, GetAllSceneJoints and GetObjectTranformMatrix
  as deprecated.
- Added "void ChangeAllCamerasViewVolume(float, float)".
Feb 08, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added the method "Scene::SetCamerasAspectRatio(const std::string& 
  cameraDescription, float newAspectRatio)".
- Now, the method "Scene::MakeCameraViewAll()" make a better modification in
  ortographic cameras.
Feb 06, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added #include <windows.h> and #define WINGDI, to avoid errors on compilation 
  under windows environment.
Dec 06, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added "void XmlPrintOn(ostream&) const".
Nov 20, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added "void Unreference(const SceneNode*)".
Aug 28, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added Pick(int, int, list<GraphicObj*>*).
- GetNumLights now returns size_t.
Jul 03, 2006 - Dalton Reis
- Unnecessary const in SetBBoxVisibility.
Jul 03, 2006 - Dalton Reis
- Added SetCamera, SetBoundingBox and SetBBoxVisibility.
- MakeCameraViewAll now use GetGreaterEdge() of BoundingBox.
May 30, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- General renaming to account for project rename (VPAT->V-ART).
- GetObjectRec and GetObject are now const methods.
- ComputeBoundingBox now checks the type of its children to call the right
  bounding box method. Other ComputeBoundingBox's bugs fixed.
- Removed bBoxShow because VPBoundingBox already has a visibility flag.
- Some documentation added.
May 17, 2006 - Dalton Reis
- Added ProcessCenter in ComputeBoundingBox and changed for bool.
May 08, 2006 - Dalton Reis
- Added ComputeBoundingBox method.
- It verifies if bounding box is visible.
Apr 20, 2006 - Cleber Souza Ughini
- GetObjectTranformMatrix created.
Mar 16, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- GetBackgroundColor now returns a constant reference.
- DrawOGL no longer clears OpenGL buffers. This should be done by viewer classes.
Feb 17, 2006 - Andreia Schneider
- Removed const from pointers in "objects" because when creating objects from
  VPXml::LoadScene, one may need to search the scene graph for pointers.
- Added method GetObjectRec.
Jun 07, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- DrawOGL now checks for existence of a current camera.
- Added description attribute and related Get/Set methods.
Dec 15, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- DrawOGL is now virtual, allowing use of derived classes in the viewers.
- The destructor now deletes objects and lights marked as "auto delete".
- Added SetAllCamerasAspectRatio, ComputeBoundingBox and GetBoundingBox.
- Removed lines of old commented coded to control scene changes.
- AddLight(const VPLight&) now makes a copy of its parameter.
- Added GetNumLights and MakeCameraViewAll.
Oct 04, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Code typing has been cleaned. DoxyGen documentation started. Indentation fixed.
- Moved "using namespace std" from header file to implementation file.
- Removed "vp" prefix from every method name.
- Changed the prototypes of GetLight, GetCamera and GetObject to avoid passing
  a string by copy.
- Added "AddLight(const VPLight&)" method because it was not possible to add a
  constant light to a scene. Changed the lists "lights" and "objects" so
  that they now keep const pointers.
- Changed cameras, lights and objects to "protected" because derived classes need
  access to them in order to call draw routines.
- Added "DrawOGL" method.
- Added "currentCamera" atribute. Added "GetCurrentCamera", "UseNextCamera"
  and "UsePreviousCamera" methods.
- Changed the type of objects from VPGraphicObj to VPSceneNode.
- Removed methods and attributes to mark changed children.
January 04, 2001 - Isabel Harb Manssour
- Addition of new methods, constants and the "typeOfChange" attribute.
- New methods implementation.
September 27, 2000 - Anderson Maciel
- New methods and attributes addition.
June 22, 2000 - Anderson Maciel
- Methods implementation.
June 08, 2000 - Luciana Porcher Nedel
- Class declaration.
May 30, 2000 - Isabel Harb Manssour
- Class declaration.
