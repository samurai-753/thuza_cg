- Changed all "Locate..." and "Traverse..." methods. Now they are const methods.
Aug 07, 2008 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Changed both FindPathTo, so that re-implementing both Traverse...First() and Locate...First()
  will affect FindPathTo.
- Added virtual void LocateBreadthFirst(SNLocator* locatorPtr) because sometimes we do not
  want to traverse the whole scene graph.
- Added virtual void LocateDepthFirst(SNLocator* locatorPtr).
- TraverseDepthFirst() and TraverseBreadthFirst() are now virtual methods.
- Removed GetPathToNodeName.
Oct 09, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added "bool DetachChild(SceneNode* childPtr)".
May 30, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added recursivePrinting (static public) attribute.
Feb 06, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added virtual SceneNode * Copy() method declaration. All derivated classes must reimplement this method.
- Added virtual SceneNode * RecursiveCopy() method implementation.
Dec 13, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added "void TraverseDepthFirst(SNOperator*)" and 
  "void TraverseBreadthFirst(SNOperator*)".
- GetNodeTypeList marked as deprecated because it does not obey parameter
  convention.
- GetChilds marked as deprecated and no longer inline.
Dec 06, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- GetPathToNodeName has been deprecated.
- Added "bool FindPathTo(const std::string&, SGPath*) const" and
  "bool RecursiveFindPathTo(const std::string&, SGPath*) const".
- FindPathTo and RecursiveFindPathTo (for SceneNode*) are now const methods.
- Added "virtual void XmlPrintOn(ostream&, unsigned int) const".
Nov 20, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider

  "SceneNode& operator=(const SceneNode&)"
Sep 12, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added FindPathTo(SceneNode*, SGPath*) and RecursiveFindPathTo(SceneNode*, SGPath*).
Aug 29, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added DrawForPicking().
May 30, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- General renaming to account for project rename (VPAT->V-ART).
- Method RecursiveBoundingBox has been removed.
- Added default case to GetNodeTypeList in order to pacify the compiler.
