- Attributes hasOvershoot and hasNoise are now initialized by Initialize (not 
  by constructor anymore).
- Replaced SetPositionalError methods with 
  void SetOvershoot(float, float) and void SetOffset(float).
- Changed Noise(): Added a protection against removing noise in short time span.
- Activation now computes new noise value. Noise with length near one, was not
  being recomputed as the action cycles around.
- Overshoot is now a percentage of total movement.

- This class now deals with interpolation errors (overshoot and offset) to
  help creating natural movements.
- Added protected static attributes (defaultNoiseAmplitude, defaultNoiseWaveLenght,
  defaultOvershoot, defaultOffset and defaultPeakTime) for easier initialization.
