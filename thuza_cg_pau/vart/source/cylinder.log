  is false.
Feb 06, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added operator '=', to create a copy of an cylinder.

- General renaming to account for project rename (VPAT->V-ART).
- ComputeRecursiveBoundingBox is no longer called automatically.
- DrawInstanceOGL now checks if it should draw the recursive bounding box.
May 08, 2006 - Dalton Reis
- Use of the ComputeRecursiveBoundingBox method instead of attributing bbox current.
Mar 16, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Changed the way how visibility of cylinder parts are handled. Added SetPartsVisibility,
  TogglePartsVisibility and GetPartsVisibility. Made ShowSide, ShowTop, ShowBottom deprecated.
  Renamed side, top and bottom to sidesVisible, topVosible and bottomVisible.
Feb 16, 2006 - Andreia Schneider
- DrawInstanceOGL modified to allow the bounding box to be drawn.
Jan 24, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- DrawInstanceOGL now respects show and howToShow attributes.
- Splitted radius attribute into topRadius and btRadius so that this class may be used
  to create cones.
- The VPCylinder(float fHi, float fRad) constructor now sets all parts to visible.
- The default constructor now creates uninitialized cylinders.
- Fixed ComputeBoundingBox.
- Added bounding computation to methods that change geometry.
Jun 01, 2005 - Andreia Schneider

- Removed "vp" prefix from every method name.
- Removed (empty) vpRender method.
- Added DrawInstanceOGL method.
