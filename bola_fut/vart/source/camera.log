May 30, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added "void ScaleVisibleVolume(float, float)".
Feb 23, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Modified the parameter radians from double to float in methods 
  void YawAroundTarget(float radians), void YawAroundTarget(float radians), 
  void Roll(float radians), void PitchAroundTarget(float radians), to avoid some 
  compiler warnings ("convertion from double to float").
Feb 08, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added "const double GetVisibleVolumeLeftLimit()  const".
- Added "const double GetVisibleVolumeRightLimit()  const".
- Added "const double GetVisibleVolumeTopLimit()  const".
- Added "const double GetVisibleVolumeBottomLimit()  const".
Jan 19, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added "void FrontVector(Point4D* resultPtr) const".
- Added "void LeftVector(Point4D* resultPtr) const".
- Added "void Roll(double radians)".
Oct 20, 2006 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added '#include <windows.h>' for compilation under MS-Windows.
Aug 29, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added SetMatrices().
Jun 07, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Moved operator<< into VART namespace.
May 30, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- General renaming to account for project rename (VPAT->V-ART).
Dec 21, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Attributes projectionType, fovY, aspectRatio, nearPlaneDistance, farPlaneDistance,
  vvLeft, vvRight, vvTop, vvBottom, location, target and up changed from private to protected.
- Removed commented old methods and attributes.
May 20, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Fixed vvBottom initialization (was 1, now is -1).
- GetDescription is now inline and returns by reference.
Dec 16, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Changed DrawOGL, so that it now sets the projection matrix.
- The projection type were changed from C preprocessor symbols to a public type
  ProjectionType. Changed GetProjectionType and SetProjectionType.
- Added aspectRatio attribute and related Get/Set methods.
- Renamed nearPlane and farPlane to nearPlaneDistance and farPlaneDistance, along
  with related Get/Set methods.
- Added vvLeft, vvRight, vvTop and vvBottom to allow any orthographic projection.
  Added related Get/Set methods.
- Commented out viewHeight, viewWidth, winBottomLeft, winTopRight and related
  Get/Set methods. It seems that they served to same purpose as vvLeft, vvRight, etc.
- Added an output operator.
- Added MoveSideways and MoveUp.
Sep 24, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Removed 'vp' preffix of every method name.
- Added methods 'YawAroundTarget', 'PitchAroundTarget', 'MoveForward' and 'Yaw'.
- Removed 'using namespace std;' from header file.
- Code typing has been cleaned (tabs replaced by spaces, excessive spaces
  removed, etc.) in the headers file because tabs and spaces were mixed together.
- Changed the class of "location", "target" and "up" to VPPoint4D.
- Added "const" to identify constant methods and to avoid copy large parameters
  (except to those that would require changing other classes).
- Added a copy constructor and "operator=" because this class is not static.
- Added "(position, focus, upVec)" constructor.
- Added "DrawOGL" method.
April/25/2001 - Isabel Harb Manssour
- New methods inclusion.
September/01/2000 - Julierme Krüger Gavião
- Gets and Sets of fovY attibute and ortho attributes modification.
June/13/2000 - Isabel Harb Manssour
- Gets and Sets update.
June 09, 2000 - Andre Rubin Santos
- Fixing Gets and Sets implementation.
