Oct 17, 2012 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added methods for "release key" events (key up).
- Joined special and normal keys (as in GLUT) in the same method.
- Deprecated HandleKey and HandleSpecialKey.
May 14, 2009 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added "static void RedisplayAll()".
- SetScene now sets the viewer camera (if unset).
- Added "void SetCamera(Camera* camPtr)".
- Added "Camera* cameraPtr" attribute, because we want different viewers showing the same scene from
  different points of view. The default camera is set at SetScene, from scene's current camera.
- Added support for special keys (arrows, Fn, etc.) handling. Thanks for Cleiton Luiz Rocha Teodoro.
Aug 07, 2008 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added #include <cstdlib>
May 30, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Fixed a bug in SetDrawHandler.
- SetSize now changes aspect ratios of cameras if needed.
- Changed resize callbacks so that visible volume is also affected.
Mar 16, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added ClearOGLBuffers() because VPScene no longer clears the buffers.
Dec 21, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added UseNextCamera().
- Added GetCurrentCamera().
- Fixed ResizeCBs - they now update "width" and "height".
Oct 06, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added HandleKey to make maintenance easier.
- Added autoNavigationEnabled and autoRespondKeys attributes.
- Added attributes width and height. Added GetWidth and GetHeight.
- Added virtual destructors.
- Fixed SetIdleHandler: now checks if the pointer is valid.
- Draw handlers are now called after the scene is drawn. This fixes problems when
  reading the frame buffer and z buffer.
- Added constructor with size. Common parts of constructors were moved to CommonConstructor,
  to make code easier to maintain.
Jun 13, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- The constructor now enables vertex arrays, fixing a bug on showing mesh objects with
  multiple viewers.
- Fixed current window management. Most methods now save the current window, then make
  glut calls, then restore the current window. -> The Idle method might need it too.
- Fixed SetTitle (now changes the icon title as well).
- Moved glutInitDisplayMode into Init.
Jun 07, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Renamed SetIdleHandlerPointer to SetIdleHandler.
- Handlers now have pointers to the viewer they are attached to.
- Added SetTitle, Iconify and PostRedisplay.
- The viewer now supports mouse handlers and uses the new mouse control class.
Apr 14, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Changed DrawCB0 to check for errors in the drawing routine because
  a lot of pleople were compiling V-ART without the rendering engine symbol. The
  new code should give a good hint on what to look for.
- Changed the list of keyboard handlers into a single handler, which required
  changing AddKbHandler to SetKbHandler.
- Changed the draw function callback into a handler object, turning SetDrawCallBack
  into SetDrawHandler.
Dec 15, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added Init. This static method should be called before creating instances.
  The second number in the version id has been incremented to show that old
  applications should be updated.
- Added SetPosition and SetSize.
- Fixed Idle function management. Now a global idle function calls every
  instance's idle fuction.
- Added autoChangeCameraAspect and resize callbacks.
- Added SetDrawCallBack, onDraw and onDrawUserPtr.
- Added user defined idle time handling (idleHndPtr, SetIdleHandlerPointer, etc.).
- Added redrawOnIdle and walkStep.
- Added modifiers (ALT, CTRL, SHIFT) to enhance built-in camera movement. MouseCB? were
  changed, constants NO_BUTTON, LEFT_BUTTON, RIGHT_BUTTON, MIDDLE_BUTTON, SHIFT_KEY,
  CTRL_KEY, ALT_KEY and Idle().
