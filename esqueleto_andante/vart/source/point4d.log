- Added "double delta" public static attribute.
- Added "bool AlmostEqual(const Point4D&) const".
- Added "double AngleTo(const Point4D&, const Point4D&) const".
- GenericAngleTo now prevents returning NaN.
Aug 07, 2008 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added Weighted Comparison.
- Added bool ZThenYLess(const Point4D& p) const.
Oct 09, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Fixed operator<< declaration (works with g++ 4.2).
- Added bool ZThenXLess(const Point4D& p) const.
- Added bool YThenZLess(const Point4D& p) const.
- Added bool YThenXLess(const Point4D& p) const.
Mar 12, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added SetXY and SetXYZ methods.
Jan 11, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added Point4D::GenericAngleTo(const Point4D& p) method. This method doesn't require 
  both vectors to be normalized, but it has poorer performance than 
  Point4D::AngleTo(const Point4D& p) method.
Jun 07, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Moved operator<< into VART namespace.
May 31, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Removed references to Vertex3D, Vector3D and Point3D.
- General renaming to account for project rename (VPAT->V-ART).
Sep 27, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Included cmath.
Apr 29, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Changed "AngleTo" - it was still returning "NaN".
Apr 14, 2005 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Changed "AngleTo" - it was returning "NaN" because of floating point errors.
  This used to make the scene disappear from the viewer when rotating the camera.
Nov 24, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added configurable order comparison methods: operator<, XThenZLess and
  LexicographicalLess.
Sep 28, 2004 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- File was created from the translation to english of an old class of mine.
- Added cast constructors and some implementations of "operator=" to easily
  blend into V-ART.
