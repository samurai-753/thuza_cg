- LoadScene(const std::string&) now returns bool as error signal (true if no errors).
- LoadScene seemed to be allocating a new light for no reason (memory leak).

- Changed calls from VART::XmlBase::GetPathFromString() method to the new class 
  VART::File::GetPathFromString().
Feb 08, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added the parameter 'const std::string& basePath' to the methods 'LoadScene()' and
  'LoadSceneNode()', to load a .xml file from a different directory.
- Modified the "XmlScene::LoadFromFile(const std::string& fileName)" implementation,
  to load a .xml file from an different directory than the current directory.
Feb 06, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- The 'result' variable of XmlScene::LoadMeshFromFile() method now is initialized
  with NULL, to avoid compile warnings.

- Vectors for dofs are now normalized after input from file.
Nov 03, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Bug fix: creation of directional lights not treating color components as
  integer numbers in range [0..255].
- Bug fix: removed memory leaks from XMLString::transcode usage.
- Moved some code to new base class "XmlBase" (note: StrX was replaced by
  TempCString and XercesString was created).
Jun 07, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Fixed declaration for operator<<.
May 30, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider

Mar 24, 2006 - Andreia Schneider
- Added rest position of dofs.
Mar 16, 2006 - Andreia Schneider
- Deleted unused VART::MeshObject pointers.
- Implemented method called LoadMeshFromFile to avoid loading a file many times.
- Implemented method LoadFromFile, that verifies if the xml parser is valid and calls the method LoadScene.
- Implemented method called ParserFile, that parsers the xml file.
- Class name has changed to VART::XmlScene and now it is child of VART::Scene class.
- Now, error messagens are shown in case of parser errors.
- DOMcountErrorHandler was renamed to ErrorHandler and was nested into VART::XML.
- StrX was nested into VART::XML.
