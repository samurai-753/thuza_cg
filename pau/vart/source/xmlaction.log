- Marked as DEPRECATED.
  This class has moved to XmlJointAction because of the new action hierarchy to accommodate new
  action types. Coded cleaned.
May 30, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Changed ParseDofMovement, error parameters are now passed through class' 
  default values.
Mar 12, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Moved the method from XmlAction::Copy() to Action::Copy().
Feb 08, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Modified "#include <sax/SAXParseException.hpp>" to 
  "#include <xercesc/sax/SAXParseException.hpp>"
Feb 06, 2007 - Leonardo Garcia Fischer
- Added XmlAction * Copy( VART::SceneNode& targetNode ) method implementation.

- changed delete [] to XERCES_CPP_NAMESPACE::XMLString::release, to avoid some errors 
  in windows environment.
Dec 06, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added "bool LoadFromFile(const std::string&, const SceneNode&)".
- Changed "void LoadAnimation(const Scene&)" to "void LoadAnimation(const Source&)".
- Added XmlAction::Source class.
Nov 03, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- XmlAction now inherits the new XmlBase class.
Oct 24, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Fixed bug: one joint mover was created for every dof mover.
- ParseFile(...) and LoadAnimation(...) changed from public to protected.
- Renamed ParserFile to ParseFile.
- ParseDofMovement() now tests for unknown dof IDs.
- Changed "bool LoadFromFile(char*, const Scene&)" to
  "bool LoadFromFile(const char*, const Scene&)".
- New parsing: Added "error" element for "dof_movement" in DTD.
- DTD file is now called "vartAnimation.dtd".
Jul 10, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- There is now a single SineInterpolator and LinearInterpolator that is shared
  among all joint movers. Other interpolators are still allocated on a per joint
  movement basis, because I'm not sure they could be shared.
- Code for parsing the dof movements was separated from LoadAnimation(...) into
  the new method ParseDofMovement(...) for easier reading.
- Added some code comments.
- Changed default priority to 1, so that if the priority is not set, the action
  will still run.
Jul 04, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Cleaned "#include" section. Includes should be in the implementation file
  unless needed by the headers.
Jun 30, 2006 - Andreia Schneider
- reading of natural interpolator implemented.
- changed the method LoadAnimation because changes of DTD file.
- Fixed reading of interpolators.
Jun 07, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Fixed declaration for operator<<.
May 30, 2006 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- General renaming to account for project rename (VPAT->V-ART).
- Changed LoadFromFile(char*, VPXmlScene*) to LoadFromFile(char*, const VPScene&).
Apr  4, 2006 - Andreia Schneider
- Methods declaration.
