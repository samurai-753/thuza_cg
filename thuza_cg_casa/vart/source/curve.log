- Renamed Transform(...) to ApplyTransform because it was conflicting with Transform class.
- General renaming to account for project rename (VPAT->V-ART).

- Code typing has been cleaned. DoxyGen documentation started.
- Changed the type of control points from "VPVertex3D" to "VPPoint4D" in order
  to compute geometrical transformations easier.
- Changed the type of "controlPoints" from pointer (C vector) to STL vector in
  order to enclose memory management control.
- Changed "controlPoints" visibility from "private" to "protected", so that
  derived classes may allocate space freely.
- Removed constructors and the destructor (this is an abstract class).
- Removed "Render" method which was not implemented.
- Removed "vp" prefix from every method name.
- Removed "#include <stdio.h>" from implementation file.
