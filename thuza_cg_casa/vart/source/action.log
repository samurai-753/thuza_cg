- Marked as DEPRECATED.
  This class has moved to JointAction because of the new action hierarchy to accommodate new
  action types with enhanced speed modifier control.
May 30, 2007 - Bruno de Oliveira Schneider
- Added frameFrequency static public attribute (float).
- Added void ModifyDofMovers(DMModifier& mod).
- Move() now resets "timeToLive" when deactivating because of elapsed time.
- Deactivate() no longer deactivates all active actions. It seems that only DOFs
  that were being used by the action need recomputation.
